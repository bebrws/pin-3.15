# Pin 3.15 - Build tools for Mac OSX

I was having trouble building for OSX so I decided to push up what I finally got to build.

I explain in source/tools/buildForMac.sh what I needed to do to get this to build

Follow any directions in there.

At most you will prob just need the bbtypes.h file and then to run the make command I was using
but with your own home directory path
